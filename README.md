# Sonar Signal Classification

This project is focused on classifying sonar signals into two categories: `Rock` or `Mine`, using a machine learning approach. The implementation is done in Python, leveraging libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Sonar Data, which contains 207 samples with 60 numerical features each, representing signal characteristics, and a label:
- `R`: Rock
- `M`: Mine

### Dataset Details:
- **Number of samples**: 207
- **Number of features**: 60
- **Label distribution**:
  - Rocks (`R`)
  - Mines (`M`)

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Loaded the dataset using pandas.
   - Performed exploratory analysis to understand the data structure and label distribution.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Separated features (`X`) from labels (`Y`).
   - Split the data into training and testing sets (90% train, 10% test) with stratification to maintain label distribution.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Used Logistic Regression for classification.
   - Trained the model on the training dataset.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy on both training and testing datasets.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Demonstrated the model's predictive capabilities with example input data.

## Results

- **Training Accuracy**: (To be filled after running the notebook)
- **Testing Accuracy**: (To be filled after running the notebook)

## Dependencies

- Python (>=3.6)
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook rockvmine.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Future Work

- Explore other machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) for better accuracy.
- Perform feature engineering or dimensionality reduction to optimize the model.
- Deploy the model as a web service for real-time predictions.
