Sonar Signal Classification

This project is focused on classifying sonar signals into two categories: Rock or Mine, using a machine learning approach. The implementation is done in Python, leveraging libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

Dataset

The dataset used is the Sonar Data, which contains 207 samples with 60 numerical features each, representing signal characteristics, and a label:

R: Rock

M: Mine

Dataset Details:

Number of samples: 207

Number of features: 60

Label distribution:

Rocks (R)

Mines (M)

Project Workflow

Data Loading and Exploration:

Loaded the dataset using pandas.

Performed exploratory analysis to understand the data structure and label distribution.

Data Preprocessing:

Separated features (X) from labels (Y).

Split the data into training and testing sets (90% train, 10% test) with stratification to maintain label distribution.

Model Building:

Used Logistic Regression for classification.

Trained the model on the training dataset.

Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy on both training and testing datasets.

Prediction:

Demonstrated the model's predictive capabilities with example input data.

Results

Training Accuracy: (To be filled after running the notebook)

Testing Accuracy: (To be filled after running the notebook)

Dependencies

Python (>=3.6)

pandas

NumPy

scikit-learn

How to Run

Clone the repository or download the files.

Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook rockvmine.ipynb

Follow the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

Future Work

Explore other machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) for better accuracy.

Perform feature engineering or dimensionality reduction to optimize the model.

Deploy the model as a web service for real-time predictions.
